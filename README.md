# Java Leetcode Solutions

## About the Repository

This repository is created to store all of my Leetcode problem solutions written in Java. As I continue to develop my problem-solving skills, I am committed to solving at least one Leetcode problem per day. This repository serves as a personal blog for each solution, documenting the process and approach.

## Structure

Each solution is stored in a separate folder, where each folder represents one approach or solution to a specific problem. Inside each solution folder, you'll find:

- A `solution.txt` file explaining the approach to the problem.
- A `.java` file containing the actual Java code for the solution.

## Problem-Solving Commitment

I am constantly improving my skills, and this repository will grow over time. Feel free to explore each solution, and if you're interested in a specific problem, you can check the corresponding folder for a detailed explanation and code implementation.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the folder of interest.
2. Read the `solution.txt` file for an explanation of the approach.
3. Review or run the `.java` file to see the implementation.

## Contributions

This repository is primarily for personal learning and growth. However, if you'd like to suggest improvements or alternative solutions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
